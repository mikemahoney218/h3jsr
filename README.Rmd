# h3jsr

h3jsr provides access to [Uber's H3 library](https://github.com/uber/h3) via its [javascript transpile](https://github.com/uber/h3-js), using the magical power of [`V8`](https://github.com/jeroen/v8).

H3 is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system. Details about its structure and use cases [can be found here](https://h3geo.org/docs/).

## Installation

Install from github with

```{r 'installation', eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("obrl-soil/h3jsr")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(h3jsr)
library(sf)

# where is the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 15?
bth <- st_sfc(st_point(c(153.023503, -27.468920)), crs = 4326)
point_to_h3(bth, res = 15)

# where is it at several resolutions?
point_to_h3(bth, res = seq(10, 15), simple = FALSE)

# Where is the center of the hexagon over the Brisbane Town 
# Hall at resolution 10?
brisbane_10 <- h3_to_point(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')
brisbane_10

# Is that a valid H3 address?
is_valid(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')

# is it a pentagon?
is_pentagon(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')

# is it Class III?
is_rc3(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')

# What is Brisbane Town Hall's base cell number?
get_base_cell(h3_address = '8abe8d12acaffff')

# What is the hexagon over the Brisbane Town Hall at resolution 10?
brisbane_hex_10 <- h3_to_polygon(input = '8abe8d12acaffff', simple = FALSE)

# if you're feeling fancy,
# point_to_h3(bth, res = seq(10,15)) %>%
#   unlist() %>%
#   h3_to_polygon(., simple = FALSE) %>%
#   mapview::mapview()
  
```

Props to Joel Gombin, who's package [`concaveman`](https://github.com/joelgombin/concaveman) provided me with the implementation inspo.
